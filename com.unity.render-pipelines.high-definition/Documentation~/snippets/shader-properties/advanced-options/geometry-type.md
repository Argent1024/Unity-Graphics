<td>**Geometry Type**</td>
<td>Indicates the type of geometry being used to represent the hair, allowing the shading model to make informed approximations. Note that switching between these two types will produce slightly differing results, due to how the underling shading model approximates the hair fiber. The options are:<br/>&#8226; **Cards**: Representation by hair "cards"; a projection of hair fibers onto a drastically simplified proxy geometry.<br/>&#8226; **Strands**: Representation by screen-aligned ribbons, or tubes; an explicit representation of a hair fiber.</td>
