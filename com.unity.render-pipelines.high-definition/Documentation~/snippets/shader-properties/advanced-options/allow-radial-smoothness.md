<tr>
<td>**Allow Radial Smoothness**</td>
<td>Adds a secondary **Radial Smoothness** block to the target, controlling the internal scattering of the light paths and absorption that occurs within the fiber. Enabling this option comes at a slight performance cost to the shader; when disabled, it will fall back to an approximation of the internal scattering.</td>
